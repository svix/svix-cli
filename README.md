A CLI to interact with the Svix API.

**With the Svix CLI, you can:**

- Interact with the Svix CLI
- Validate Webhook payloads


## Installation

Homebrew Tap & Scoop Bucket Coming soon.

For now, you can download the binary executable and use it straight away without having to install any additional dependencies.
1) Find the latest release, download the tar.gz file for your given operating system and extract it.
2) Inside you'll find the `svix` executable which you can run directly (Note: you may need to allow execution via `chmod +x <PATH_TO_SVIX_EXE>`),

On macOS or Linux, you can move this file to `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin` locations to have it be runnable from anywhere; or place it anywhere and add it to your path (ex. `export PATH=$PATH:<PATH_TO_SVIX_EXE>`) Otherwise, simply `cd` to the folder where you extracted the tar.gz file and run it with ./svix.


## Usage

Installing the Svix CLI provides access to the `svix` command.

```sh
sivx [command]

# Run `svix help` for information about the available commands
svix help

# or add the `--help` flag to any command for a more detailed description and list of flags
svix [command] --help
```


## Quick Start

```sh
# Set your Auth Token temporarily via the SVIX_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable
export SVIX_AUTH_TOKEN=<MY-AUTH-TOKEN>
# or to persistently store your auth token in a config file run
